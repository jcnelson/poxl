## Contributing

For more information on the project, its goals, and technical details, please review the [Product Requirements Document](./citycoin-prd.md).

PRs are welcome! Please see the [open issues](https://github.com/citycoins/citycoin/issues) and comment if interested, or submit a PR for review.

All code submitted should be thoroughly commented and tested where applicable.

## Testing

Contracts are tested via [clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) and typescript.

To test the contract using `clarinet`, first [install the tool](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet#installation) to make it available on your system.

Several commands are available to help with testing via `npm`:

- to run the prepare script:
  `npm run clarinet:prepare`
- to run all tests:
  `npm test`, `npm run test`, `npm run clarinet:test`
- to run individual tests:
  `npm run test:auth`
  `npm run test:core`
  `npm run test:token`
- to run specific clarinet functions
  `npm run clarinet:check`
  `npm run clarinet:codecov`
  `npm run console`, `npm run clarinet:console`

A bash script is provided to prepare the tests as part of `clarinet:prepare`, and executes the following steps:

1. copies all contract files from `./contracts` to `./contracts/clarinet`
2. modifies address used in impl-trait by replacing it with a different address. e.g.
   `(impl-trait 'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE.sip-10-ft-standard.ft-trait)`
   is converted to:
   `(impl-trait 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE.sip-10-ft-standard.ft-trait)`
3. appends code stored in `./contracts/test_addons` at the end of contract file with the same name
   e.g. `./contracts/test_addons/citycoin-core-v1.clar` is added to `./contracts/citycoin-core-v1.clar`

**Note:** `clarinet:test`, `clarinet:check`, and `clarinet:console` automatically execute `clarinet:prepare`.
